Task-1 :-portfolio task 
I have completed a small *portfolio project* based on *HTML and CSS*.  
It is a simple structure that contains the following sections:

- *Header* â†’ My name is written here  
- *About Me* â†’ Short introduction about myself  
- *Education* â†’ My academic background  
- *Skills* â†’ My technical skills  
- *Projects* â†’ Work samples and projects  
- *Contact Me* â†’ Ways to reach me  
- *Footer* â†’ Closing section  

This is just a *basic portfolio* project created for practice purposes.  
It is not very detailed or complex, but a good starting point for web development journey. ðŸš€
